## Climate Scientist

#### Technical Skills: Python, Fortran, MATLAB

## Education
• Ph.D.        Physical Oceanography| University of Tasmania   (_Dec 2024_)

• B.Sc.        Physical Oceanography| Ocean University of China(_Dec 2019_)

## About me
I am an oceanographer with a PhD in Physical Oceanography from the University of Tasmania (UTAS) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Hobart, Tasmania. My work uses numerical models (ocean and sea ice), observations, and theory to understand the interactions between Antarctica, sea ice, and ocean and their roles in our changing climate. These experiences fuel my strong ambition to advance the understanding of cryosphere-ocean interactions and their implications for future sea level and global climate systems.
• Physical Oceanography • Southern Ocean dynamics • Sea ice-Ocean modelling • Antarctic meltwater • Climate variability • Climate model coupling • Polar and climate science • Tidal modelling

I have a passion for running ocean and climate models, and I have hands-on experience with:
Coupled model: ACCESS-OM2
Ocean models: MOM5, MOM6, ROMS
Sea Ice models: CICE5, CICE6
Global tide model: DEBOT

I am also an Antarctic Expedition Guide and Onboard Scientist/Lecturer with Silversea Cruises (2022-2023), sharing my expertise in Antarctic exploration and research. I am passionate about polar science and committed to advancing environmental understanding and promoting equity in scientific endeavours.

If you're interested in my work and/or Antarctica, let's Talk! 
I am enthusiastic about discussing innovative projects, exchanging ideas, and exploring collaborative opportunities.
